# New Tab G

[New Tag G](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-g/nfkcmdcjnelhmnaippjpmbameoaploik) is a Chromium browser extension that redirects new tabs (not homepage) to `https://www.google.com`.

It is incredibly simple, free, and no special Chromium permissions are required to use.

It is also not configurable, and no support is provided. Nor is it affiliated with Google.

Use it at your own risk.
